# cf-rest-svc

This is a simple ansible playbook I created to poll the CloudForms rest API and return a list of service catalog item IDs & names.  You can then supply one of those IDs, along with a VM name to order that catalog item.  

It makes a few assumptions and my catalog ID is hard coded.  Really, I did this for a demo and don't plan on doing anything further with this.  If it can be of use to others, though, have at it.
